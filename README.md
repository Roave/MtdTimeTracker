MtdTimeTracker
==============

Introduction
------------
Version 0.0.1 created by Ben Youngblood for MediaTech Designs, LLC.

This is a simple time tracker that will allow employees to track how much time
they spend (a) at work and (b) on different projects.

Current Goals
-------------
 - Simple time session tracking with splits (pause/resume without changing
   sessions) [COMPLETE]
 - Ease payroll administration with simple reports [TODO]
 - Track billable hours for clients [TODO]
 - Track time on multiple projects within the same session [TODO]
 - Track and analyze employee work habits [TODO]

Future Ideas
------------
 - Github (or just git) integration (track commits or diffs?)
 - Calendar/todo list integration (for organizations that are not
   software-oriented)
 - Take over the world (for the ambitious small business or non-profit)
